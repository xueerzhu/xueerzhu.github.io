Of all the game design research paper I've read in college, one stood out to me: `Operational Logic and Playable Models`

It discusses what makes [this game](http://hcsoftware.sourceforge.net/passage/) remarkable. 

It's argument on Operational Logic was so refreshing and it still is the best answer to the question I ask myself - "`Why do I like Florence and What Remains of Edith Finch but not many other narrative focused video games?`"

So here is my summary of the narrative design in games works well based on the research:

`Navigatioin` = computation algorithm + media communication   

How do you navigate in the game? Some algorithms and level design determines where you could and could not go, how you go there, in what sequence you get there, etc.
Plus, media communication that speaks to you viscerably about how you might feel getting there. Difficult, hardship, sacrafice, grateful, heartbroken, betrayed... 
Algorithm is lifeless, add emotions to it. But let algorithms control what it is good at, keep choices diverse, engaging and make consequences everchanging, not static. 

`Collision` -> life with meanings beyond convention

Conflict, conflict, conflict... Allow narrative to create conflicts, go beyond convention. Give it room so it could emerge into a state that is more than what the writers prepared for the game. 

Such logic and models comes from fims (moving images) like `cuts and pan`

So how to implement? According to original words of the author
First: Game state presentation

Second: Gameplay experience

That's the end of a short reflection of what makes certain storytelling games work for me!
