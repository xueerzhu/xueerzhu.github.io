Besides `Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor`'s [Nemesis System](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3ShGfJkLcU), something else I love about this game is how things you do fits so well in its narrative. 

For example, it introduces you sneaking mechanics through Talion's tender moment of interaction with his wife:

![Shadow of Mordor - sneaking tutorial](/assets/sneaking-tutorial.jpg)

`Hold SHIFT for stealth. While in stealth, press LEFT BUTTON to kiss your wife.`

If you've played the game or have seen the intro cutscene, you probably would know how much this moment adds to the revenge element of theme. 

Similarly, let's look at how `Dishonored` teaches its own sneaking mechanic:

![Dishonored - sneaking tutorial](/assets/hide-and-seek-tutorial.jpg)

`Press C to enter stealth mode. Play Hide and Seek with Emily. Find a place to hide!`

Under both occasions, I learned the tender lovely side of both characters, besides the hardcore badasses we already expect them to be. 
The melting of storytelling and gameplay mechanics during the tutorial session of these games are effective, and I'd love to see it more often in games!
