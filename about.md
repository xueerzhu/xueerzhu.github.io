I am a senior studying Computer Science: Computer Game Design at UCSC. 


In summer 2019, I was a Software Engineer Intern at Zynga, San Francisco. Before, I served as research assistant and student developer on several projects at university computer science labs and computational media department.


My projects can be viewd on ![Glitch](https://glitch.com/@xueerzhu), ![Github](https://github.com/xueerzhu), and of course, my ![portfolio](). 


I am seeking full time job opportunities in client tech, gameplay and AI in 2020.
