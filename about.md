I am a senior at UCSC, studying Computer Science: Computer Game Design. 

Working at the intersection of game design and software engineering,  I had the privilege of influencing digital softwares and games used and loved for their educational and entertainment values. These include Zynga's Hit it Rich mobile game, MoleculeView, a VR educational game, and researches on computer science tutoring AI and game assistance AI. 

Last summer, I was a software engineer intern at Zynga in San Francisco. Before, I served as research assistant and student developer at university computer science labs on different projects.

I am seeking full time job opportunities in client tech, gameplay and AI in 2020.
